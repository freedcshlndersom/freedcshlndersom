Where to find a business loan will depend on a few factors, including your time in business and how quickly you need the cash. You can find payroll loans at any institution that offers business loans.

Alternative lenders: Many businesses can benefit from alternative lending, often via online lenders, when they need a payroll loan. Online lenders characteristically have fast turnaround times, often offering approval and funding within 24 hours of a small business loan application. Alternative lenders have both short-term loans and lines of credit and may be willing to consider new businesses and startups.
Traditional banks: Traditional banks often have the lowest interest rates, but they also have an underwriting process that can take time. These loans are best for businesses with at least a few years in operation who don’t need money today. If you think you’ll need a payroll loan in a couple of months, apply for a traditional loan or line of credit now.
