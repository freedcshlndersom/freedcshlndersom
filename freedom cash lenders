If you can’t get approved for a short-term business loan, the costs of a short-term loan are too high or would like to consider other options, there are alternatives. You can use these funds for working capital and long-term expenses, freeing up your cash flow for payroll costs. Here are a few alternatives to consider:

Business credit cards. Business credit cards offer revolving credit and often have introductory offers or rewards and perks. Additionally, you won’t be charged interest if you don’t carry a monthly balance.
Grants. Grants are free money that doesn’t have to be repaid. You may find regional or federal grants for businesses in your industry.
SBA loans. The government backs SBA loans. They have interest rate caps, making them a good choice if the need for funds isn’t immediate.
