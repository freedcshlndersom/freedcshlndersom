Payroll loans are business loans that provide funding for businesses that may be short on cash for things like employee benefits, wages and payroll taxes. Payroll loans refer to how you use the lending funds instead of a specific financial product. You can use short-term small business loans, lines of credit or other types of funding to stay ahead of payroll when money is tight.
